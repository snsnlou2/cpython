"fixdiv - tool to fix division operators.\n\nTo use this tool, first run `python -Qwarnall yourscript.py 2>warnings'.\nThis runs the script `yourscript.py' while writing warning messages\nabout all uses of the classic division operator to the file\n`warnings'.  The warnings look like this:\n\n  <file>:<line>: DeprecationWarning: classic <type> division\n\nThe warnings are written to stderr, so you must use `2>' for the I/O\nredirect.  I know of no way to redirect stderr on Windows in a DOS\nbox, so you will have to modify the script to set sys.stderr to some\nkind of log file if you want to do this on Windows.\n\nThe warnings are not limited to the script; modules imported by the\nscript may also trigger warnings.  In fact a useful technique is to\nwrite a test script specifically intended to exercise all code in a\nparticular module or set of modules.\n\nThen run `python fixdiv.py warnings'.  This first reads the warnings,\nlooking for classic division warnings, and sorts them by file name and\nline number.  Then, for each file that received at least one warning,\nit parses the file and tries to match the warnings up to the division\noperators found in the source code.  If it is successful, it writes\nits findings to stdout, preceded by a line of dashes and a line of the\nform:\n\n  Index: <file>\n\nIf the only findings found are suggestions to change a / operator into\na // operator, the output is acceptable input for the Unix 'patch'\nprogram.\n\nHere are the possible messages on stdout (N stands for a line number):\n\n- A plain-diff-style change ('NcN', a line marked by '<', a line\n  containing '---', and a line marked by '>'):\n\n  A / operator was found that should be changed to //.  This is the\n  recommendation when only int and/or long arguments were seen.\n\n- 'True division / operator at line N' and a line marked by '=':\n\n  A / operator was found that can remain unchanged.  This is the\n  recommendation when only float and/or complex arguments were seen.\n\n- 'Ambiguous / operator (..., ...) at line N', line marked by '?':\n\n  A / operator was found for which int or long as well as float or\n  complex arguments were seen.  This is highly unlikely; if it occurs,\n  you may have to restructure the code to keep the classic semantics,\n  or maybe you don't care about the classic semantics.\n\n- 'No conclusive evidence on line N', line marked by '*':\n\n  A / operator was found for which no warnings were seen.  This could\n  be code that was never executed, or code that was only executed\n  with user-defined objects as arguments.  You will have to\n  investigate further.  Note that // can be overloaded separately from\n  /, using __floordiv__.  True division can also be separately\n  overloaded, using __truediv__.  Classic division should be the same\n  as either of those.  (XXX should I add a warning for division on\n  user-defined objects, to disambiguate this case from code that was\n  never executed?)\n\n- 'Phantom ... warnings for line N', line marked by '*':\n\n  A warning was seen for a line not containing a / operator.  The most\n  likely cause is a warning about code executed by 'exec' or eval()\n  (see note below), or an indirect invocation of the / operator, for\n  example via the div() function in the operator module.  It could\n  also be caused by a change to the file between the time the test\n  script was run to collect warnings and the time fixdiv was run.\n\n- 'More than one / operator in line N'; or\n  'More than one / operator per statement in lines N-N':\n\n  The scanner found more than one / operator on a single line, or in a\n  statement split across multiple lines.  Because the warnings\n  framework doesn't (and can't) show the offset within the line, and\n  the code generator doesn't always give the correct line number for\n  operations in a multi-line statement, we can't be sure whether all\n  operators in the statement were executed.  To be on the safe side,\n  by default a warning is issued about this case.  In practice, these\n  cases are usually safe, and the -m option suppresses these warning.\n\n- 'Can't find the / operator in line N', line marked by '*':\n\n  This really shouldn't happen.  It means that the tokenize module\n  reported a '/' operator but the line it returns didn't contain a '/'\n  character at the indicated position.\n\n- 'Bad warning for line N: XYZ', line marked by '*':\n\n  This really shouldn't happen.  It means that a 'classic XYZ\n  division' warning was read with XYZ being something other than\n  'int', 'long', 'float', or 'complex'.\n\nNotes:\n\n- The augmented assignment operator /= is handled the same way as the\n  / operator.\n\n- This tool never looks at the // operator; no warnings are ever\n  generated for use of this operator.\n\n- This tool never looks at the / operator when a future division\n  statement is in effect; no warnings are generated in this case, and\n  because the tool only looks at files for which at least one classic\n  division warning was seen, it will never look at files containing a\n  future division statement.\n\n- Warnings may be issued for code not read from a file, but executed\n  using the exec() or eval() functions.  These may have\n  <string> in the filename position, in which case the fixdiv script\n  will attempt and fail to open a file named '<string>' and issue a\n  warning about this failure; or these may be reported as 'Phantom'\n  warnings (see above).  You're on your own to deal with these.  You\n  could make all recommended changes and add a future division\n  statement to all affected files, and then re-run the test script; it\n  should not issue any warnings.  If there are any, and you have a\n  hard time tracking down where they are generated, you can use the\n  -Werror option to force an error instead of a first warning,\n  generating a traceback.\n\n- The tool should be run from the same directory as that from which\n  the original script was run, otherwise it won't be able to open\n  files given by relative pathnames.\n"
