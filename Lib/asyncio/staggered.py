    "Run coroutines with staggered start times and take the first to finish.\n\n    This method takes an iterable of coroutine functions. The first one is\n    started immediately. From then on, whenever the immediately preceding one\n    fails (raises an exception), or when *delay* seconds has passed, the next\n    coroutine is started. This continues until one of the coroutines complete\n    successfully, in which case all others are cancelled, or until all\n    coroutines fail.\n\n    The coroutines provided should be well-behaved in the following way:\n\n    * They should only ``return`` if completed successfully.\n\n    * They should always raise an exception if they did not complete\n      successfully. In particular, if they handle cancellation, they should\n      probably reraise, like this::\n\n        try:\n            # do work\n        except asyncio.CancelledError:\n            # undo partially completed work\n            raise\n\n    Args:\n        coro_fns: an iterable of coroutine functions, i.e. callables that\n            return a coroutine object when called. Use ``functools.partial`` or\n            lambdas to pass arguments.\n\n        delay: amount of time, in seconds, between starting coroutines. If\n            ``None``, the coroutines will run sequentially.\n\n        loop: the event loop to use.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple *(winner_result, winner_index, exceptions)* where\n\n        - *winner_result*: the result of the winning coroutine, or ``None``\n          if no coroutines won.\n\n        - *winner_index*: the index of the winning coroutine in\n          ``coro_fns``, or ``None`` if no coroutines won. If the winning\n          coroutine may return None on success, *winner_index* can be used\n          to definitively determine whether any coroutine won.\n\n        - *exceptions*: list of exceptions returned by the coroutines.\n          ``len(exceptions)`` is equal to the number of coroutines actually\n          started, and the order is the same as in ``coro_fns``. The winning\n          coroutine's entry is ``None``.\n\n    "
