Consider it as an experimental API that\n    might be changed or removed in Python 3.8.\n\n    Event methods, such as `create_server` and `create_connection`,\n    accept factories that return protocols that implement this interface.\n\n    The idea of BufferedProtocol is that it allows to manually allocate\n    and control the receive buffer.  Event loops can then use the buffer\n    provided by the protocol to avoid unnecessary data copies.  This\n    can result in noticeable performance improvement for protocols that\n    receive big amounts of data.
