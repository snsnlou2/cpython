'A generally useful event scheduler class.\n\nEach instance of this class manages its own queue.\nNo multi-threading is implied; you are supposed to hack that\nyourself, or use a single instance per application.\n\nEach instance is parametrized with two functions, one that is\nsupposed to return the current time, one that is supposed to\nimplement a delay.  You can implement real-time scheduling by\nsubstituting time and sleep from built-in module time, or you can\nimplement simulated time by writing your own functions.  This can\nalso be used to integrate scheduling with STDWIN events; the delay\nfunction is allowed to modify the queue.  Time can be expressed as\nintegers or floating point numbers, as long as it is consistent.\n\nEvents are specified by tuples (time, priority, action, argument, kwargs).\nAs in UNIX, lower priority numbers mean higher priority; in this\nway the queue can be maintained as a priority queue.  Execution of the\nevent means calling the action function, passing it the argument\nsequence in "argument" (remember that in Python, multiple function\narguments are be packed in a sequence) and keyword parameters in "kwargs".\nThe action function may be an instance method so it\nhas another way to reference private data (besides global variables).\n'
