class WidgetRedirector():
    "Support for redirecting arbitrary widget subcommands.\n\n    Some Tk operations don't normally pass through tkinter.  For example, if a\n    character is inserted into a Text widget by pressing a key, a default Tk\n    binding to the widget's 'insert' operation is activated, and the Tk library\n    processes the insert without calling back into tkinter.\n\n    Although a binding to <Key> could be made via tkinter, what we really want\n    to do is to hook the Tk 'insert' operation itself.  For one thing, we want\n    a text.insert call in idle code to have the same effect as a key press.\n\n    When a widget is instantiated, a Tcl command is created whose name is the\n    same as the pathname widget._w.  This command is used to invoke the various\n    widget operations, e.g. insert (for a Text widget). We are going to hook\n    this command and provide a facility ('register') to intercept the widget\n    operation.  We will also intercept method calls on the tkinter class\n    instance that represents the tk widget.\n\n    In IDLE, WidgetRedirector is used in Percolator to intercept Text\n    commands.  The function being registered provides access to the top\n    of a Percolator chain.  At the bottom of the chain is a call to the\n    original Tk widget operation.\n    "
