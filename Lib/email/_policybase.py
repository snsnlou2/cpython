Policy objects are immutable,\n    but a new Policy object can be created with only certain values changed by\n    calling the Policy instance with keyword arguments.  Policy objects can\n    also be added, producing a new Policy object in which the non-default\n    attributes set in the right hand operand overwrite those specified in the\n    left operand.\n\n    Settable attributes:\n\n    raise_on_defect     -- If true, then defects should be raised as errors.\n                           Default: False.\n\n    linesep             -- string containing the value to use as separation\n                           between output lines.
